            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><em>Hola!</em> Welcome to my little space. My name is Melissa Flores. I am from Honduras and currently live in Canada. <br>I am a native Spanish speaker and can speak English too <em>(well, I try)</em>. Learning a new language has been a challenging experience, but honestly, it has enriched my life in many aspects and made me feel proud of myself. I enjoy spending time with my loved ones and making new friends. I am also a coffee and sushi lover.</p>
