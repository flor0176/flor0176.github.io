                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p><em>Â¡Hola!</em>, Welcome to this little space.<br><br>I'm Melissa Flores, originally from Honduras, and I decided to come to Canada to pursue my personal growth goals: study abroad and improve my English proficiency. As a native Spanish speaker, learning a new language has been a <em>challenging experience</em>, but honestly, it has enriched my life in many aspects and makes me feel <strong>proud of myself</strong>. I like to learn new skills, especially those requiring my <em>creativity, problem-solving and attention to detail</em>.</p> 
                <p>I enjoy spending time with my loved ones and making new friends. I am a coffee and sushi lover. In my free time, I love to bake and try new recipes.<br>I also enjoy photography, anime and dancing. I have a dog, her name is <em>Cake</em>, she is a little schnauzer and she has been part of the family since 2017(her birthday was on January 14<sup>th</sup>).<br>Finally, I am a full-time student in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program at Algonquin College, and I look forward to learning the essential web development and design skills that will contribute to my professional growth and achieve my goals.<br><br><img src="images/cake-my-pet.jpg" title="cake my pet" alt="Image of a dog"><br>
